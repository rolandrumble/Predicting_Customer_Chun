# Predicting_Customer_Chun
Any business wants to maximize the number of customers. To achieve this goal, it is important not only to try to attract new ones, but also to retain existing ones. 
Retaining a client will cost the company less than attracting a new one. In addition, a new client may be weakly interested in business services and it will be difficult to work with him, 
while old clients already have the necessary data on interaction with the service.

### Problem Statement 		  
We curated data of customers from an insurance firm across 3 different countries.Predicting customer churn is an essential task for companys to prevent users from logging off or cancelling paid services. 
With a proper ML model it is possible to identify users who are likely to churn. I decided to build a Machine Learning Model predicting customer churn using different machine learning Models
with the aim of selecting the best model that fits the required Prediction.

## The Data
The data consisted of 10,000 rows consisting of 14 features.
